Users have the opportunity to manage a stock portfolio with fictitious money, which allows them to get started with the stock market without any financial risk. The site offers varied features such as buying and selling stocks, setting up recurring investment plans (Dollar Cost Averaging, or DCA) and managing stop orders to optimize trading strategies. By bringing together a very extensive catalog of stocks, BoursePlay comes as close as possible to the functionalities offered by real stock exchange platforms, thus facilitating the transition for those who plan to launch into real trading. The main objective is to allow users to familiarize themselves with the world of the stock market and understand market dynamics in a fun and educational way."
